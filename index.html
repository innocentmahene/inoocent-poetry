        content: `Come, my brethren, let us drink from the well of life,
For the season is ripe, and the waters run deep.
Now is the time ‚Äî when joy overflows,
Let us embrace the sacred irony of life.

Come, my brethren,
Let us hold hands in peace,
And drink from the fountain of love,
For unity is sweetest when it is shared.

But the season is drawing to a close,
The dry winds begin to whisper.
Soon the fountains will trickle,
And the streams of love will fade.

The hands we hold today may slowly drift apart,
The thirst for life will grow deeper by the second.
A time will come when children turn from their fathers ‚Äî
a wives fight with there loved ones,
And love will ache in silence.`

And stars blink stories yet unknown,
I find your shadow in the moon,
Dancing to a distant tune.

The winds may steal the warmth of day,
But in the dark, your soul will stay.
In every hush, in every sigh,
I meet your voice, I don't know why.`

        content: `
It was a cold night ‚Äî the night your father died,
A murder in cold blood,
A symbol of fury,
A burst of rage that rang true.

It was the most beautiful thing I ever saw,
A well-orchestrated departure of a soul.
A killing so graceful, it felt poetic ‚Äî
A crime born of passion, deep at its core.

And though I ache to mourn my husband‚Äôs end,
I pause... to admire the artist‚Äôs hand.
The killer who painted in blood and grief ‚Äî
A masterpiece wrapped in silent belief.

        I can smell it with my skin ‚Äî
The greatest invention of man:
The red flower.

As beautiful as it may seem,
Its bloom is a warning,
For danger awaits.
The larger it grows, the deeper the doom,
The heavier the scars it leaves behind ‚Äî
The red flower.

It devours all in its path,
Feeding on the dry, the weak, the defenseless.
On its rise to glory,
It cloaks itself in a whispering white mist.

The majestic red flower.
Some say it‚Äôs orange.
Others say it‚Äôs gold.
But whatever the shade,
The red flower is no jolly old soul.

        The Devil‚Äôs Therapist
This man walks into my office
In a black suit and black leather Italian shoes.
This man walks into my office
With a huge smile on his face.
This man walks into my office
Holding a huge ego in his hands.

This man ‚Äî this sad, mysterious man.

I knew it was all fake the moment I looked into his eyes.
Another egotistic attempt
To make everything look fine.

Another patient, I presumed ‚Äî
Another psychological case.
But this case was like no other.

He claimed to be the devil.
He called himself Lucifer.
‚ÄúYou don‚Äôt know how hard it is to be the devil,‚Äù he said.

I saw the pain in his heart
The moment he said that.
I wanted to say ‚ÄúI do,‚Äù
Like I always tell my patients‚Ä¶
But this time, it felt different.

Another metaphoric case?
I named it The Case of the Lost Devil.
And so it was ‚Äî
I became the devil‚Äôs therapist.

At first, I thought it was a metaphor.
But with each second,
The metaphor began to feel real.
And then ‚Äî
He showed me his devil face.

A wave of horror clouded my mind.
Even my thoughts became a case of their own.

It was like hell had been brought to me.
But strangely‚Ä¶
It didn‚Äôt feel like a punishment.

He wasn‚Äôt terrifying ‚Äî
He was tired.
Just another lost soul,
Seeking help from me.

Another lost soul, I told myself‚Ä¶
But that‚Äôs when it hit me:
The devil has no soul.

Still, I whispered,
‚ÄúThis must be God‚Äôs will.‚Äù
But if it was,
Would the devil have complied?
Or was he here to kill me?

I pushed those thoughts aside.
I still had a job to do ‚Äî
A job that kept a meal on the table

        An open heart I give to you,
In hopes that you‚Äôll open yours too.
I offer you my everything,
And dream of calling you my queen.

I cast aside my ways of sin,
In hopes that love will let me win.
I wait for you to take my hand‚Äî
Mine‚Äôs already reaching, where you stand.

I look into your eyes: I see hope.
Each rejection only helps me cope.
With every "no" that strikes me through,
I see more clearly‚ÄîI love you.
There‚Äôs nothing you can say or do
To dim the light I see in you.

So take my hands, and be mine,
And I‚Äôll take yours‚Äîyou‚Äôll be divine.
Together, all will turn out right:
Our love will live beyond the night,
Forever burning, bold and clever‚Äî
A flame that dies... never

        For it‚Äôs the end that gives the beginning its meaning.
        It is the exact moment that has been whispering,
        Calling me to the commencement of life.

        For it is the irony of it all that makes life less ironic‚Äî
        That makes our lives more precious:
        That death is the one that calls us to life,
        That the real symbol of life... is death.

        I sit on the bed as my soul leaves the flesh,
        Hanging on that last string of life,
        Clinging to my final breath,
        And I ask myself‚Äî
        What if the real beginning of life... is death?

        And before I can tell anyone, I find out:
        Death is the true beginning of life‚Äî
        Sweeter than honey and milk,
        Life in the silver city.

        When the heavens and hells start to call‚Äî
        Each one asking for my soul.

        That is when I realize the sweetness of life,
        The real meaning of it all.
        We do not only live to die,
        We live to enjoy‚Ä¶ and enjoy to die.

        When my eyes open to the other side, I finally realize:
        We also die to live.
        And I ask myself‚Äî
        Does the irony of life get more ironic?

        And guess what‚Ä¶ it‚Äôs deeper than irony.

        It‚Äôs been three days...
        But I still hear the noises.
        Every time I sit beneath the moon,
        I still hear your screams,
        Your voice crying, ‚ÄúLet me go.‚Äù

        Warm tears find their way from my eyes,
        Down my sorrow-drenched cheeks,
        Quiet sobs escaping my lips.

        But my ego won't let me.
        The thought that it's not my fault
        Spins around my head again and again.

        Every night under the moon
        Is another night in hell.
        Every night beneath the dark clouds
        Brings another rain of tears.
        And every night in bed alone
        Is another night... of nightmares.

        The weight behind each breath I take,
        The silence screaming loud and scorning,
        A heart that bends but will not break.

        The heavy burdens stitched in thread,
        Of dreams I chase but never claim,
        Of voices echoing in my head,
        Whispering sorrow in my name.

        And yet, somehow, I find it sweet‚Äî
        The ache that dances in my chest,
        A melody of slow defeat,

        It tells me I‚Äôm alive, still here,
        Still standing in the pouring rain,
        Still wiping off each fallen tear,
        Still feeling... the sweetest pain.

        It‚Äôs not the joy that makes me real,
        But every scar that I conceal,
        Every wound that didn‚Äôt bleed‚Äî
        But whispered softly: ‚ÄúYou still need.‚Äù

        And though the nights are cold and long,
        And hope feels fragile, thin, and worn,
        This pain has shaped where I belong‚Äî
        A rose that bloomed among the thorns.
